# Time-Series-Course
# Time-Series This repository contains codes I developed for time series analysis in the Econometrics II course during my Masterâ€™s in Economics. The codes here were developed and refined based on code examples provided by the professor (V. Possebom). The analyses include studies of economic data and estimations of ARIMA, VAR, and VEC models.
