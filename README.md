# Time-Series
This repository contains codes I developed for time series analysis in the Econometrics II course during my Master’s in Economics. The codes here were developed and refined based on code examples provided by the professor (V. Possebom). The analyses include studies of economic data and estimations of ARIMA, VAR, and VEC models. 

### Problem Set 1 
The file contains code examples to forecast Brazilian annual GDP growth between 2021 and 2030. The exercises contain forecasts for several ARIMA models.

### Problem Set 2
The file contains code examples to test whether the stochastic process has a unit root or not.

### Problem Set 3
The file contains code examples to run ADL(p, q) models and VAR(p) models to forecast GDP growth and structural IRFs.

### Problem Set 4
The file contains code examples to run cointegration tests when the cointegration vector is known and unknown. Furthermore, there is an example of Johansen’s cointegration test.
